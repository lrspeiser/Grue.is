Portraits from generations of Hogwarts' finest whisper and giggle above you. The room is empty, save for the flickering shadows that dance along the walls. A staircase spirals upward, leading to the dormitories, while the main door leads back into the bustling hallways of Hogwarts. \n\nIn your hand, a note: \"Meet me in the library. Urgent. -Hermione\"\n\nDo you want to head to the library to meet Hermione or do something else?"

The scent of old parchment and magic hangs in the air. Madam Pince, the librarian, watches over the room with a hawkish eye. Countless shelves stretch out before you, filled with books that cover every conceivable subject within the wizarding world. To your left, a large window overlooks the Forbidden Forest, casting a serene glow over a nearby study table. To your right, a restricted section is roped off, a warning sign hanging ominously on the rope.\n\n**Do you want to explore the shelves for a particular book, head to the study table by the window, or try your luck sneaking into the restricted section?**"
