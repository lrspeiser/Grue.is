      "response": "Welcome to your own magical adventure, inspired by the world of Harry Potter. You've just received your letter to Hogwarts, and as you hold the parchment in your hands, you feel a mixture of excitement and nerves about the journey ahead. The letter tells you to meet at King's Cross Station, Platform 9 ¾, on September 1st.\n\nYou're standing outside King's Cross, with people bustling around, unaware of the magic hidden in plain sight. You have your ticket, your wand safely tucked in your trunk, and an owl in a cage. Your heart races with the thought of stepping onto the platform.\n\n**What do you want to do?** Do you ask someone for directions to the platform, try to find it yourself, or maybe do something else entirely?"
