Grue
Grue is an omage to the old text based adventure games like Zork.
I wanted to see what would happen if we wired one of those up to a GPT dungeon master.
Only issue was, I don't know how to program. I decided to see if I could direct GPT to write it for me.
I was very pleased with the outcome. 

How to get the most out of an LLM as a non-programmer
  - Picking your environment: A real programmer would have chosen an IDE like Visual Studio for their desktop. I tried a few of these and ran into environmental setup problems too often. I attempted to ask the LLM to explain how to fix them, but they gave instructions that I often failed to understand or did not match the interface I looked at. This would not be a problem for a real programmer, but I wanted results immediately. This is where Replit really shines. I want to compliment this team for building such an incredible experience. I'd seen my kids use this when learning programming, and now I understood why. I didn't have to NPM this or that in the shell. I just started using a function and it took care of everything. I wanted to compile and run by code, no issues. Need a database, done. Want to deploy to the web, easy. This allowed me to focus the LLM on only one thing, code. However, this did impact some decisions later.
  - Choosing your language: I started by building a simple program that was only accessible via the console log. I chose Python based on its popularity as the example code used for API docs. Generally it worked well and if I were a programmer I might have stayed with it. However I ran into one issue that was a non-starter for a non-programmer. Python's insistance on proper formatting. LLMs would often give me a chunk of code to replace. When I would paste it in, I would mess up the tabs. I started tried to refine my prompts to fix this, but I was impatient. I mean, that's why I never became a computer programmer, I'm too impatient to learn the right way. I cut corners. That's why I start companies, to get out of hard work :). So getting the formatting to work was too much effort. Friends told me that modern IDEs would have solved this for me, but per my first point about environments, I was not willing to trade. Because I wasn't doing the code, what did I care which language I chose. 
  - Console.logs, the eyes of the LLM
  - Prompt engineering
  - Memory issues and why being a connoisseur is valuable
  - One change at a time

What to expect
  - When context windows get large
  - If LLMs ever wire up to compilers
  - As code that uses LLMs get incorporated into LLMs

Future of programming
  - Does this put programmers out of a job?
  - What should your kids study?
  - The outcome of all of this code
